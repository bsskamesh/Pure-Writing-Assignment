## Benefits of Public Cloud
For businesses, the ability to deploy databases or retain superior backups does not make them better than their competitors. What differentiates a business is how well it runs its processes to meet the needs of the customers. IT tasks that are common, repetitive, and time-consuming can be shifted to Cloud, allowing businesses to focus and innovate on customer goals.
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. For example, a business needs needs 100 virtual desktops and 1000 terabytes of storage for the tax season. The company can deploy resources instantly in Cloud and return them after the tax season. Cloud offers flexibility and pricing according to the usage of resources, which is impossible when a company manages its own infrastructure.
In addition, Cloud offers the following benefits:
- **Avoid upfront expenses**: When you are a new business, you cannot know how you are going to use computing resources. Instead of investing highly in data centers upfront, pay only for resources you consume.
- **Focus less on maintaining infrastructure**: Maintaining your own infrastructure often requires you to spend additional money and time. Cloud computing enables you to focus less on IT tasks and more on your applications and customers.
- **Stop guessing capacity**: Cloud computing allows you to scale in or scale out based on capacity. Cloud prevents the hassle of paying for unused resources or having to deal with limited capacity. Access only the capacity that you need. 
- **Implement innovative solutions**: Deploying resources on Cloud is easy and quick. This flexibility provides you with more time to experiment and implement innovative solutions, while saving on costs.
- **Go global in minutes**: Cloud enables you to deliver content to customers around the world quickly, while providing them with low latency.
