## Benefits of Public Cloud
For businesses, the ability to deploy databases or retain superior backups does not make them better than their competitors. What differentiates a business is how well it runs its processes to meet the needs of the customers. IT tasks that are common, repetitive, and time-consuming can be shifted to Cloud, allowing businesses to focus and innovate on customer goals.

Public Cloud is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the public internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. 

For example, a business needs needs 100 virtual desktops and 1000 terabytes of storage for the tax season. The company can deploy resources instantly in Cloud and return them after the tax season. Cloud offers flexibility and pricing according to the usage of resources, which is impossible when a company manages its own infrastructure.

In addition, Public Cloud offers the following benefits:
- **Avoid upfront expenses**: When you are a new business, you cannot know how you are going to use computing resources. Instead of investing highly in data centers upfront, pay only for resources you consume.
- **Focus less on maintaining infrastructure**: Maintaining your own infrastructure often requires you to spend additional money and time. Cloud computing enables you to focus less on IT tasks and more on your applications and customers.
- **Stop guessing capacity**: Cloud computing allows you to scale in or scale out based on capacity. Cloud prevents the hassle of paying for unused resources or having to deal with limited capacity. Access only the capacity that you need. 
- **Implement innovative solutions**: Deploying resources on Cloud is easy and quick. This flexibility provides you with more time to experiment and implement innovative solutions, while saving on costs.
- **Go global in minutes**: Cloud enables you to deliver content to customers around the world quickly, while providing them with low latency.

## Some Solutions to Beat Traffic Congestion
When industrial production and traffic were shut down for 6 weeks starting from March 2019, river dolphins returned to Ganga, the Dhauladhar mountain range of Himachal was visible after 30 years from Jalandhar in Punjab, and the air quality index (AQI) of Bangalore hovered around 20.

While we cannot ban traffic completely or stop industries permanently, here are some solutions I propose to beat traffic congestion in Bangalore:
- **Reduce self occupancy of vehicles**: Bangalore has the second largest number of vehicles (more than 10 million) in India. During peak hours, 50% of cars have single occupancy. Instead of banning cars during peak times or implementing odd-even systems, both private companies and government organizations must provide work from home options, incentivize employees to use cycles or public transport, and charge for workplace parking. 
- **Emphasise on public transport**: Bangalore with its flyovers and lack of viable public transport encourages private transportation. Increasing the length of buses (with multiple doors) and their frequency, and reducing the cost of bus tickets will help bring people back to using buses. Provide feeder buses or provision rental cycles from metro stations for the last mile connectivity. 
- **Improve cycling infrastructure**: If Bangalore designs cycle lanes with reduced conflicts between cars, cycles, and pedestrians, most commuters would prefer using cycles. Protected cycle lanes could effectively reduce traffic congestion.
- **Using existing rail network**: Running local trains regularly in congested corridors (City station to Whitefield, Yashwantpur to Hosur, and City Station to Devanahalli) can reduce congestion. Update the infrastructure of all the local stations, and provide buses from the local stations to commercial and residental areas.
- **Optimize traffic management**: Use technology to effectively maximize road capacity. Co-ordinate traffic lights in response to demand, improve road conditions by using CCTVs and proactively repair roads, implement existing road traffic laws strictly, reduce illegal parking, and ban loading and unloading by delivery vehicles during peak hours.
