## Benefits of Public Cloud

The ability to deploy databases or retain superior backups does not make a business better than its competitors. What differentiates a business is how well it responds to the needs of the customers. IT tasks that are common, repetitive, and time-consuming can be shifted to Cloud, allowing companies to focus and innovate on customer requirements.

Public Cloud is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the public internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. 

For example, suppose a business needs 100 virtual desktops and 1000 terabytes of storage for the tax season. The company can deploy resources instantly in Cloud and return them afterwards. Cloud offers flexibility and pricing according to the usage of resources, which is impossible when a company manages its own infrastructure.

In addition, Public Cloud offers the following benefits:
- **Avoid upfront expenses**: When you are a new business, you cannot know how you are going to use computing resources. Instead of investing highly in data centers upfront, pay only for resources you consume.
- **Focus less on maintaining infrastructure**: Maintaining your own infrastructure requires lots of money, time, and people. Cloud computing enables you to focus less on IT tasks and more on your applications and customers.
- **Stop guessing capacity**: Cloud computing allows you to scale in or scale out based on capacity. Cloud prevents the hassle of paying for unused resources or having to deal with limited capacity. Access only the capacity that you need. 
- **Implement innovative solutions**: Deploying resources on Cloud is easy and quick. This flexibility provides you with more time to experiment and implement innovative solutions, while saving on costs.
- **Go global in minutes**: Public cloud enables you to deliver content to customers around the world quickly and with low latency.

## Beating Traffic Congestion in Bangalore
When industrial production and traffic were shut down in India for 6 weeks recently, river dolphins returned to Ganga, the Dhauladhar mountain range of Himachal was visible after 30 years from Jalandhar in Punjab, and the air quality index (AQI) of Bangalore hovered around 20.

While we cannot ban traffic completely or stop industries permanently, here are some solutions I propose to beat traffic congestion in Bangalore:
- **Reduce self occupancy of vehicles**: Bangalore has the second largest number of vehicles (more than 10 million) in India. During peak hours, 50% of cars have single occupancy. Instead of banning cars during peak times or implementing odd-even systems, both private companies and government organizations should continue to provide work from home options, incentivize employees to use cycles or public transport, and charge for workplace parking. 
- **Emphasise on public transport**: Bangalore with its flyovers and lack of viable public transport encourages private transportation. To bring people back to using buses, increase the length of buses and their frequency, and reduce the cost of bus tickets. Provide feeder buses or provision rental cycles from metro stations for last mile connectivity. 
- **Improve cycling infrastructure**: If Bangalore designs cycle lanes with reduced conflicts between cars, cycles, and pedestrians, most commuters would prefer using cycles. Protected cycle lanes could effectively reduce traffic congestion.
- **Using existing rail network**: Running local trains regularly in congested corridors (City station to Whitefield, Yashwantpur to Hosur, and City station to Devanahalli) can reduce congestion. Update the infrastructure of all the local stations, and provide buses from the local stations to both commercial and residental areas.
- **Optimize traffic management**: Use technology to effectively maximize road capacity. Co-ordinate traffic lights in response to demand, improve road conditions by using CCTVs and proactively repair roads, implement existing road traffic laws strictly, reduce illegal parking, and ban loading and unloading by delivery vehicles on main roads during peak hours.
